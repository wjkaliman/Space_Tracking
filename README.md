Here’s a fast recap of the satellite project so far:
•	Identified observers for 3I/ATLAS
I compiled a working list of spacecrafts with good geometry to observe 3I/ATLAS: Mars orbiters (Mars Express, MRO, MAVEN, ExoMars TGO, Tianwen-1, Hope), deep-space missions with potential vantage (JUICE, Juno, Psyche, Solar Orbiter, Lucy), and Earth-system telescopes (Hubble, JWST).
•	Confirmed catalog identifiers
For each spacecraft, I gathered NORAD (SatCat) IDs and COSPAR IDs (where applicable).
•	Built a structured dataset
I created a CSV with rich fields:
Name, NORAD_ID, COSPAR_ID, Operator, Mission_Type, Launch_Date_UTC, Current_Location, Earth_TLE_Available, Notes, 3I_ATLAS_View_Utility.
Download: 3I_ATLAS_satellites_with_NORAD.csv
•	Added quick triage metadata
Included a “3I_ATLAS_View_Utility” estimate (High/Medium/Unknown) based on likely observational geometry, plus a flag for whether Earth TLEs are routinely available (useful for HST/JWST vs. interplanetary craft).
This has been a fun challenge.
